The final library is constructed simply by concatenating the three
files found here, in the order

* `preamble.inc`
* `tiling_data.inc`
* `tactile.inc`

The file `tiling_data.inc` is generated automatically by a separate
program (not included here).  This directory can safely be ignored by just about everyoneâ€”the main file to use is in the `lib/` folder.
