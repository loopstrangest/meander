This folder contains the source code for an interactive Javascript tool that allows you to draw spiral tilings. See the blog post at http://isohedral.ca/escher-like-spiral-tilings/ for more information, including a link to a runnable version.

If you want to run this code yourself from source, you'll need to run a web server. Because Chrome is afraid of cross-site scripting attacks, this script won't run via a `file:` URL.  It suffices to run Python's web server by executing "`python -m http.server`" from the command line while in the main directory.
