From README.md:

General:
Made by Craig S. Kaplan
Caplan utilizes P5.js for a demo
81 interesting tiling types
Each has 0 - 6 free parameters

Imports:
Class IsohedralTiling describes a specific tiling and its prototile
Array tilingTypes with length numTypes contains the 81 tiling types
getParameters and setParameters to access the positions of the tiling vertices

Edges:
S edges are identical after 180 degree rotation
U edges are identical after reflecting across one axis
I edges are identical after rotation and reflection (only I - straight line - does this)
J edges can be a path of any shape
An edge shape starts at (0, 0) and ends at (1, 0)
Some tricky stuff regarding U and S edges

Laying Tiles:
Iterator-based approach for filling a region of a plane with prototiles
